            " Overview Quick access {{child.heading}} Computer Science Study Computer Science You are here: Master's degree program in Autonome Systeme und Robotik In this research-oriented Master's program, students expand their subject-specific and interdisciplinary competencies from a previous Bachelor's program. Graduates are qualified for research and development work in basic research or in industry. Overview Content and structure Students arrange their curriculum from numerous courses in four mandatory elective and elective areas: These represent the four core areas necessary for autonomous systems and robotics. Students have a high level of freedom in the design of their curriculum, allowing them to pursue their individual interests. Mandatory elective areas ensure that students acquire the necessary basic knowledge as well as the specific knowledge and skills essential for the course of study. Due to the close cooperation with other relevant departments of the TU Darmstadt, the study programme offers a particularly diverse range of courses. Additional offerings come primarily from electrical and information engineering as well as mechanical engineering. Take a look at the module handbook to learn more about the courses offered. A major strength of the program are the integrated projects and labs. Here, students have the opportunity to participate in challenging projects in cutting-edge international research. Below you will find the exemplary course of studies. More detailed information on study and examination plans can be as found of June 2023 under “ Regulations ” at the bottom of the page. Structure overview Admission General information The admission requirement for the Master's program in Autonomous Systems and Robotics (M.Sc.) is the completion of a program that provides competencies amounting to at least 180 credit points (CP). Of these, at least 60 CP must not be significantly different from the entry-level skills acquired in the Bachelor's program in Computer Science (B.Sc.) at the TU Darmstadt (comparable program, see section “Formal prerequisites”). Formal Entrance Examination The entry competencies are proven by the certificate of the first degree and the Diploma Supplement or comparable documents submitted with the application. Material Entrance Examination If the entry-level skills could not be clearly clarified in this way, a written examination will be conducted. Admission with remedial coursework If, after the entrance examination, it is found that the applicant lacks entry-level skills that can be compensated for by making up achievements in the amount of no more than 30 CP, admission can be made subject to remedial coursework. This must be completed within the first two semesters . Which modules or subject examinations are chosen as remedial coursework and by when they must be completed will be listed in the admission notification.

            " Overview Quick access {{child.heading}} You are here: back to list New Master's degree program in Autonomous Systems and Robotics Start in winter semester 2023/24 / Online application possible until 31.8. 2023/06/02 Robots are supposed to make more tasks easier for humans in the future. But how can we get them to independently master new tasks and cooperate with us? With the new Master's program Autonomous Systems and Robotics with German as language of instruction, the Department of Computer Science combines modern computer science methods with knowledge from classical engineering education. Through close cooperation with other relevant departments at the TU, the program offers a particularly diverse range of courses. What exactly awaits the students and what job opportunities do the graduates have? Professor Jan Peters from the Department of Computer Science provides answers about the new degree program. Why this M.Sc. program, Professor Peters? Technical systems have evolved considerably: While the car was still a classic domain of mechanical engineering 10 years ago, a new Tesla is more like a computer on wheels. Sensors and motors are interconnected in ever larger networks and coordinated by computers. Rescue robots are used as first responders in disaster areas and anthropomorphic robots are on the verge of their breakthrough. To meet these great challenges, we need a new kind of computer scientist in the field of autonomous systems and robotics. For who is this M.Sc. program well-suited? What can students expect? This M.Sc. program is designed for students who want to use their computer science knowledge to change the real, physical world. Other computer science M.Sc. programs only consider the computer as an autonomous system that had its sensors and actuators amputated. The Autonomous Systems and Robotics M.Sc. program, on the other hand, gives students a holistic education. They learn to enable computers to perceive their world via sensors or to plan and execute changes in their environment. Professor Jan Peters, Vice Chairperson of Academic Affairs The degree program is designed for students who want to use their computer science knowledge to change the real, physical world. Are there comparable M.Sc. program in Germany? Autonomous systems and robotics can only be studied in Germany at the universities in Darmstadt, Stuttgart and Lübeck. But their M.Sc. programs are fundamentally different! TU Darmstadt’s M.Sc. program attempts to cover the full spectrum of autonomous systems and robotics and to provides an introduction to a variety of fundamental topics and practical applications. This great degree is only possible because a particularly large number of good researchers and teachers are active in this field at the TU Darmstadt. Stuttgart University’s M.Sc. program is more specialised in industrial applications – especially in production – and the Lübeck University’s M.Sc. program is primarily suited for medical robotics. What job opportunities will graduates have? Due to the computerisation of all technical systems and the fact that German engineering courses typically do not teach the sufficient programming and software engineering skills, the demand for technically oriented computer scientists cannot be met in the foreseeable future. Since all technical systems are becoming more and more autonomous and the current wave of new intelligent robots application, outstanding careers will obviously await our graduates. Master's program in Autonomous Systems and Robotics (Language of Instruction: German) Robots already make many tasks easier for humans in the future. But how can we get them to handle new tasks independently? How do we teach them to cooperate with humans in our complex, human-centred world? With the Master's program in Autonomous Systems and Robotics with German as language of instruction, the department combines modern computer science with classical engineering education. Through close cooperation with other engineering departments at TU Darmstadt, the degree programme offers a particularly diverse range of courses. Additional courses are primarily offered by the depts of electrical engineering and information technology as well as mechanical engineering. Elective areas ensure that students acquire the specialist knowledge and technical abilities essential for applying this knowledge to the real world. At the same time, the electives offered, e.g. in the Studium Generale, give students a lot of freedom to set their own focal points. A great strength of the degree programmes are the integrated projects and practical labs. Here, students have the opportunity to participate in challenging research projects of high international saliency. Graduates face an innovative and promising job market with diverse perspectives in industry, business and research. They can help shape our future as system engineers or software developers in research institutions or in areas of research, development and application in companies.
